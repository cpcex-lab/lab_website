The main objective of the book is to be a practical tutorial on the use and application of techniques and methods of automated content analysis in Portuguese through the `R` language.

Based on the production of material for the Text as Data course: automated content analysis taught at MQ-UFMG in 2019 by Davi Moreira and on the article co-authored with Maurício Izumi (Izumi and Moreira 2018), this book aims to disseminate in the social sciences and technical humanities and methods of automated content analysis using the `R` language.

*The book is organized by Davi Moreira, with his authorship and also by Mônica Rocabado.*
Special thanks to the organizers of MQ-UFMG 2019, Manoel Galdino, Rafael Magalhães, Lincon Ribeiro and Umberto Mignozzetti.

The book is written using the bookdown package (Xie 2019), through R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
