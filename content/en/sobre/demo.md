The **Computational and Experimental Political Science Laboratory** (`@cpcex_lab`) develops scientific research projects and applied projects in Political Science and International Relations with intensive use of experimental and computational methods. `@cpcex_lab` has 3 goals:

1. Answer scientific questions in Political Science and International Relations that causal inference and computational learning methods can solve;

2. Apply computational and experimental approaches to environmental, political representation, human development, transparency and public policy projects;

3. Produce and disseminate courses and teaching materials related to the area;
