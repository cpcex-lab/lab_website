I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Quantitative Theory and Methods Department at Emory University. I use comparative politics and political economy tools, with a regional focus in Latin America, to investigate how to improve public goods provision in developing democracies. My research combines formal modeling, experiments, elite and popular surveys, and archival research.
